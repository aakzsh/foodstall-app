# Foodstall

Food is an essential part of human existence. I mean the intro line wasn't supposed to be so serious. Well, lemme try to explain why we made Foodstall through a case 
study based upon myself. So, I used to have this amazing place at my neighborhood that used to sell momo and rolls. But suddenly the shop disappeared one day. The shop was like a stall, not properly setup, so there was no exact address, and I didn't have the contact number of the person either. That is something that Foodstall could've solved. Foodstall focuses on bringing spotlight to these small food restaurants, that lack address and a proper identity. That was our inspiration to build this project.

# API

The code to the API is at https://github.com/aakzsh/foodstall-api

# Running Locally

Make sure you have flutter installed. Add your stepzen and mongo db data API key in the code, setup a data API on mongoDB, and once all this is done, you're good to run it locally.

```flutter pub get```
```flutter run```
